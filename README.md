# hello-world
this is a sample repository which contains some generic files for no reason at all. Github is dope man!
the git startguide is asking me to write something about myself. 
okay.
Well lets talk about it later becuase as this repo is public and I don't have any money to make a private repo. 
so yeah! you understand what I'm trying to say.
